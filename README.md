# pick
- Whaleshares comment picker forked from esteemapp/pick
- Helps you pick out a comment to one of your posts for winning contests, etc.

Dec 2017 - Our good friend @good-karma on steem released this tool, as explained here:
https://steemit.com/pick/@good-karma/introducing-pick-1318f9f21506e

It is recommended you follow and vote witness good-karma for the steem blockchain for sharing the source code to this tool.

### intelliwitness (aka intelliguy) has ported the code over to Whaleshares so it can be used on this chain too!

You can download the source code and run it on your own computer.

## Try it online with this temporary website test:
### http://pick.appservers.ml

(Better URL will be released soon)

## Syntax for picking a random comment is this:
### username/title-of-steem-post

For instance, if this was the post:
https://whaleshares.io/whaleshares/@intelliguy/whaleshares-and-steem-they-serve-different-purposes-and-can-exist-together

### You would ONLY enter this:
### intelliguy/whaleshares-and-steem-they-serve-different-purposes-and-can-exist-together
