# pick
Whaleshares comment picker forked from esteemapp/pick

Dec 2017 - Our good friend @good-karma on steem released this tool, as explained here:
https://steemit.com/pick/@good-karma/introducing-pick-1318f9f21506e

It is recommended you follow and vote witness good-karma for the steem blockchain.

Thanks to his free contribution to society and releasing the source code, intelliwitness (aka intelliguy) has ported the code over to Whaleshares so it can be used here as well.

You can download the source code and run it on your own computer.

OR, using a browser simply go to this temporary website to try it:
http://danevent.ml/pick

(Better URL will be released soon)

Syntax for picking a random comment is this:
username/title-of-steem-post

For instance, if this was the post:
https://whaleshares.io/whaleshares/@intelliguy/whaleshares-and-steem-they-serve-different-purposes-and-can-exist-together

You would ONLY enter this:
intelliguy/whaleshares-and-steem-they-serve-different-purposes-and-can-exist-together

Pick Random Winner
* This goes through all of the main comments, and picks a random one

Top Rewarded
* This searches all of the main comments, and picks the one that rewarded your post with the most whalestake

Top Engaged
* This searches all of the main comments and finds which comment spawned the most threaded discussion

Top Earned
* This searches and finds the person who got the highest comment reward for commenting

If you have any questions, contact intelliguy on discord, or send email to intelliguy@tuta.io

Special thanks goes to good-karma for releasing this app originally and allowing it to be forked.
